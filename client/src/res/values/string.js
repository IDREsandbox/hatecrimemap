    TEXT: "The Hate Crime Map offers an anonymous platform for victims of hate-based assault and \
            crime to record their experiences so that researchers and policy makers have accurate \
            information about the causes and locations of hate crimes. In addition to reporting crimes, \
            you can search the data by race, gender, religion and other factors. To see data, hover \
            over a state. To report harassment or assault, click on “Report Incident” on toolbar.” \

        PARAGRAPH1: "Hate crime and harassment is a national and global human rights problem. Incidents are on the rise, but statistics are notoriously unreliable. The definition of hate crime varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, underreporting is widespread, and law enforcement is reluctant to designate crimes as hate crimes. The need for a publicly available resource documenting hate-based harassment and crimes has never been greater.",
        PARAGRAPH2: "Mapping Hate Crimes in the US seeks to address this need by providing a crowd-sourced platform that enables victims to report hate-based incidents. In addition to self-reported incidents, reports are culled from newspapers, and ProPublica and the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center have shared their data.",
        EMAIL: "aisc@ucla.edu",
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS1: "This map was made possible with funding from the UCLA Institute of American Cultures, UCLA Division of Social Sciences, and the UCLA American Indian Studies Center. Data was graciously provided by ProPublica’s Documenting Hate project and the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center. Published incidents were culled from newspaper reports by UCLA American Indian Studies Center staff and from self-reporting.",
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS2: "Special thanks go to Campus GIS Coordinator Albert Kochaphum, UCLA Institute of Digital Research & Education, and Christopher Lam, brilliant UCLA engineering student, for their extraordinary work in creating a functional and sophisticated, yet accessible, map. \
        Another special thanks to Luke Dalton, a UCLA engineering student, \
        and Mariah Tso, a geographic information systems specialist working at the UCLA Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, for their invaluable work in refining the project further.",
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS3: "Further thanks go to Tanner Velten who laid \
        the essential programming foundation for the map in its current iteration. Thanks also go to the \
        originators of the \"Harass Map,\" which formed the foundation of the current map: Patrick Meier, \
        PhD, a consultant on humanitarian technology and innovation; Andrew Schroeder, a geographic information\
        systems expert; and Vanessa Díaz, assistant professor of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies at Loyola Marymount\
        University. Final thanks to August Bai at Quantitative Analyst, Fannie Mae, and Aaron Cheng, \"rising\" senior at Menlo School, for helping to provide the COVID-19 data from Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center."
