Iâ€™m here because of some sudden and uncontrollable dry heaving that Iâ€™ve experienced on and off the past few years, and has gotten worse the past couple of months. 
 
 I approached the front window, seeing a person presenting as an older white woman, who I assumed to be the front desk person. Expecting to be greeted and directed to check in, instead she stood still and stared at me without saying anything, her face a mixture of suspicion and apprehension. 
 
 I didnâ€™t know what to do. For a second, I wondered if I walked into the wrong office. I said â€œUh hello?â€ 
 
 She then pointed at a laminated sheet beneath me and paraphrased the text, with a hint of worry, asking me â€œHave you traveled from outside the country?â€ 
 
 â€œNo I haven't.â€ 
 
 She still looked at me with suspicion, like I was concealing something. I then told her, â€œI have a 10am appointment? With Dr. Schwartzbauer?â€ 
 
 She then seemed to wake up and said, â€œOh, you have to sign in.â€ As I signed in I said, â€œI feel like weâ€™re having an awkward encounter for some reason.â€ She replied, â€œIâ€™m sorry, itâ€™s because youâ€™re a new patient and you didnâ€™t know what to do!â€ I said, â€œRight, I didn't. I also know there were 3 cases reported yesterday in Maryland, so I understand if people might be a little on edge...â€ 
 
 She quickly replied, in a serious tone, â€œYeah they were reported right here. In this county.""
 
 After I sat down, 2 more patients approached the window. Unlike me, she nicely greeted both of them, asking them if they were coughing or exhibited other symptoms, as listed on the laminated sheet. She didnâ€™t ask them if they had traveled abroad. They both presented as older white men. 
 
 Still feeling bothered, I told the Dr. Schwartzbauer what happened. She immediately apologized and promised to have a talk with her.",,

I was so surprised, so taken aback that I asked him to repeat it because I couldnâ€™t believe it.
 
 â€œSo it is something thatâ€™s happening and what I find most surprising is that its happening in front of our faces, directly at people. That is something that I have not experienced in a very long time.â€
 
 Tapper expressed his sympathies and support for Lah.
 
 â€œIâ€™m so sorry you experienced that,â€ he said. â€œI would just like to note that if you are stupid and racist enough to be holding random individuals of Asian descent responsible for a pandemic, you should be self-quarantining from society.â€",https://asamnews.com/2020/03/21/journalist-called-racial-slur-while-covering-coronavirus-cnn-anchor-jake-tapper-expresses-outrage/?fbclid=IwAR2OoZo6myJeoAw2p9I21qZw0L3Zid1cbI6iKhq4wsw2wgUAERj_hbsBJ8U,

I am a heart patient and had two open surgeries and ongoing heart illness. 
 When I went to see my cardiologist on 3-10 in her clinic. When a assistant name Sarai Manzo called me a in a room asked me a routine questions like, have I been to outside of county last 14 days? or Do I have a fever or cough etc. 
 Also she asked me do I know anyone who traveled outside of US or contact with virus? 
 I told her that I don't know anyone who has a virus or traveled outside of US, but I go to a Gym everyday, and I overheard some ladies talking about one of the member went to Mexico 2 months ago, that's all I said, and as soon as she heard Mexico she got up and left the room right away without saying anything. She didn't hear the whole sentence or words, she just left the room. 
 
 I waited in a small room for 30 minutes and finally I asked one of the lady at the front desk about why the doctor would not come and see me? As soon as I asked that question she yelled at me "" Get back inside of the room and closed the door"" I told her that I could not breath in a small room so I tried to open the door but she wouldn't let me open the door. 
 All of sudden they thought that I was carrying a Coronavirus. 
 Finally assistant and nurse name Cindy came into a room with fully mask on their face and told me that the doctor will not see you and you need to leave. I asked her why? 
 You told us that you went to Mexico Cruise and you need to be quarantine. 
 I told them I never went on a Mexico cruise or went outside of country. 
 But they wouldn't want to hear the truth from me, they kept on saying you have a virus and it's our hospital policy and we can't treat it you. You need to go home. 
 I told them over and over but they just told me to get out and doctor wouldn't come to see me. They don't want to hear the truth from me. 
 
 They wrongfully accused me be on that Mexico cruise and having a virus therefore, they denied my medical treatment to jeopardize my health.
 Next day I had a severe chest pain I had to go to Washington Hospital Emergency Room near my home. 
 How could they denied medical treatment to a person with heart disease and don't want to hear the truth from the patient? 
 A doctor should come to a room and asked me a one simple question than everything will be fine, but NO, doctor was afraid or didn't want to hear the truth. 
 They know that I am a Korean or Asian and thought I went to Mexico Cruise, therefore, they didn't want to treated me all.
 
 I was treated worse than an animal in that small room. I told them I can't breath but they would not let me open the door for air. 
 They would not put their own dog in a small room to be hyperventilated. 
 As soon as I got out of the office I called my lawyer and told them what exactly happened and he was so shocked and couldn't believe what just happened.
 Also, nurse name Cindy at the Cardiologist office sent an email to Palo Alto Medical Foundation for everyone can see that I have a Coronavirus. She sent a lie email to a Medical foundation. 
 So all the nurses and doctor wouldn't treated me when they see an email, which put my life in a dangerous situation. 
 I was so hurt by this and they totally discriminated me from getting a medical treatment. 
 
 I know this virus is giving everyone in a panic situation, but people in a medical field should be more caring and compassionate instead of judging people and accused me of something that never happened. 
 
 The Cardiologist should have come into a room and asked me directly but she never showed up at all. My primary doctor was furious and called her next day to tell the truth about this untruth incident, Dr. Bhambani left for a vacation next day.",I have a copy of email that nurse sent it to Palo Alto Medical Foundation.,

As my Southwest flight was boarding soon, I hurried through TSA and rushed through the walkway to my terminal gates. A passenger exiting the gates (elderly, tall, white male, wearing a dark green blazer) glared me and spit at my feet as we crossed paths. At the time, I didn't bother to look back as I didn't want to miss my flight. I boarded my flight without any issues, and as I was about to take off, I sank into my seat realizing what had happened. I regretted not saying or doing anything except putting all of my focus into walking to catch my flight. I pondered if what I was wearing had anything to do with the incident as well - a black t-shirt (design: a white-filled rectangle across my chest with the silhouette of ""RESIST"" in all-caps sans-serif letters), tan wool coat, light-blue ripped jeans, and light-brown dress shoes.
 
 I landed at my layover connection - Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW). During most of the layover, I walked throughout the airport browsing the different shops and amenities, noticing some mild stares here and there. A couple hours passed, and it was time to board my connecting Southwest flight to SFO. As I get in line for boarding, the first boarding group (the group I belonged in) was starting to board. I asked a white, female passenger what boarding number she had - her number was slightly after mine. Before I get a chance to explain that I had an earlier boarding number, she averted her eyes from mine, covered her face, and continued boarding. I ended up boarding at the end of that boarding group, behind a younger man who happened to be wearing a MAGA hat.
 
 On the flight from MDW to SFO, there were four flight attendants: two who I perceived to be Asian/Asian American, two who I perceived to be white. I happened to be sitting in a section of the aircraft that one of the white female flight attendants was servicing. During the flight, the flight attendant stopped at my seat to take my beverage order: I asked to redeem a drink coupon for an alcoholic beverage and for some water. The flight attendant moved on. As they were preparing the drink orders, flight attendants moved throughout the cabin distributing snacks. The flight attendant serving my section handed everyone their snacks; when she got to my seat, I extended my hand to receive my snack but she instead disregarded my gesture and dropped my snack in my lap. In distributing the collected beverage orders, this flight attendant brought me the alcoholic beverage I ordered but not the water. I chose to give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking that she might have forgotten. Later in the flight, she brought out a tray of water-filled cups - I requested water again and noticed that she had one cup remaining. She did not give me the cup of water, and no one else had wanted it. She gestured something that I didn't make out, walked back to her station at the end of the aircraft, and returned to our section with another tray of water-filled cups. This time, other passengers had gestured for water (as well as myself) and she ignored me, distributing cups of water, and returning to her station with a few undistributed cups of water left on her tray. Annoyed, I went to the lavatory at the front of the aircraft cabin. After using the lavatory, I asked the flight attendant at the adjacent station (who I perceived to be of Asian/Asian American descent) for water, which she handed me in a matter of moments. When our flight landed and the flight attendants were collectively facilitating our deboarding, the aforementioned white female flight attendant made eye contact with me and turned away as I passed her to exit the aircraft. 
 
 The experiences I listed were just *half* of the racist and xenophobic encounters I experienced during this overall trip. But generally speaking, my encounters with racism and xenophobia have been (and continue to be) especially prevalent around the transit and air travel industries. To this day, I have not reported anything to any airports or airlines and I still wonder if I can and should.",,

 ""So ... We were just attacked by an old white guy at a gas station. I don't know if he was high or sick, but he started screaming at Hideyo for stealing his car. He stomped on the car (we were all in it) and he put his fists up to my husband. If I thought my kids didn't know the words fuck, shit, asshole, or faggot, they do now. No one intervened: not other patrons, nor the attendant. So ... You tell me how to unpack this with my children. Mental illness? Racism? General prejudice? Trump's America? Yup, I'm gonna cry later. **
 
 ** Okay, now that Iâ€™ve cried, I should add that we are all safe. Hideyo (East bay hood life) was like â€œOh, thatâ€™s not the worst Iâ€™ve ever experienced ... he didnâ€™t REALLY want to fight meâ€ and while there is a sizeable dent on the side of the car ... if thatâ€™s the worst of it, I am ok with that. I should also add that I donâ€™t think it was racially motivated (we were the car closest to him) but likely a mental illness issue. Iâ€™m just sad that no one intervened. I also wonder if I did enough to protect my kids, because true to form, I did what I do best when actually confronted with conflict â€” I freeze.

I then told her I wasnâ€™t close to her even though she said I was but I really wasnâ€™t then I said to her Iâ€™m not going to argue with you. She quickly turned around and I said to her sheâ€™s racist and said that to me because Iâ€™m Asian and she didnâ€™t say anything back after. I felt like she was targeting me since I was the only Asian person in that store and the other people from behind me and In front of her were not following the 6 feet distance but she only told me the only Asian in the store while everyone else was Hispanic or African American. I felt so discriminated and insulted after that. I wanted to report this on here so many people are aware especially the Asian American community about the insults and assaults Asian Americans have been getting because of the coronavirus. I left very angry and sad as Iâ€™ve never experienced anything like that in my life and as a young college student I felt thatâ€™s why I was targeted too. The hate against innocent Asian Americans because of the coronavirus needs to stop and something must be done with all these insults and assaults. Many Asian Americans like myself do not feel safe not only because of the virus but also because of the fear of being insulted or assaulted just because of our race/ethnicity and because the virus came from a country in Asia. 
 
 Another incident i would like to share is I was visiting a family friend in South LA and as I was walking back to my car from his house a random guy on the street then yelled out to me to bring him some chinese food since he said he was hungry and craving it he said and that he also said That he might get the carona virus from eating it if I brought it he said.

I did not even look at them once and did not retaliate and kept myself to myself. I think they wanted a reaction from me so they could hurt me physically and I was scared. 
 
 When I tried to walk the opposite way from them one of them had their phone out and started recording it looked like and the person recording threw a tin of potatoes at my head with quite a lot of force and shouted â€œif I ever see you around again you diseased creature, I will personally shoot you with my AR-15â€

I just completed my case of the morning and while leaving, I needed to fill some gas. I turned into my usual gas station that I like to stop before hopping on the highway. I remember feeling pretty happy that prices were down. Approaching the gas station, I noticed some irregular potholes at the entrance, so I slowed down moderately to safely enter the station. A white SUV which was turning from another direction tailed me into the gas station and started screaming obscenities that I could hear through my closed windows. She rushed around parallel to my car on the other side of the gas pumps as I moved forward to my usual spot, then swerved around violently to block my car head-on from proceeding any further. I thought sincerely she was going to hit my car, so I stopped and stared at her aghast while she rolled her window down and screamed with such intense vitriol and unbelievable hate I have never experienced personally in my life. I remember clearly the look on her face. The moment was surreal and I sat stunned in my car. From a distant part of my head, I saw her license plate reflected in my side mirror and I thought for a moment, maybe I should memorize it or take a picture. But, all I was able to do was to just sit there stunned. I'm born and raised 30 miles from where this occurred. I was brought up with a mixed cultural background, so being 'Asian' is not something I have specifically identified, although I always felt especially in my younger years I was constantly pegged into the category. I am an Ohioan and I'm an American. I've completed my education in Ohio, stayed in Ohio for medical school, residency training, then now my second fellowship. To be reduced in my home state, no - my home - by someone by just how I look pierces painful holes in much of what I worked for to overcome ""just how I look."" This is not the America I'm proud of. And I know while this is not ever coming from the people I know and love, I felt fear. I felt fear of my personhood and I worried deeply about my parents and my friends of Asian heritage. I felt fear of the dark, secret hatred that festers in people as we try to face the unknown together. 
 
 I think one point that I learned from this incident, is that despite the madness, there are kind people out there. At the gas station afterward, a woman asked if I was okay. Unsure of what else to say or feel at the moment, I thanked her and said yes.
 
 I appreciate the opportunity to share this story. I am not avidly on social media in a personal sense and while I threw around in my head a way to share this, I also felt maybe I shouldn't.

This one happened two days ago. I use my Korean nickname as a username in league of legends(video game) and I did not even say my race. But because of my username, in the game chat I was being called â€œcorona virusâ€ and the teammate told the other team and our other teammates to stay away from me. It wasnâ€™t as bad as what happened yesterday. Yesterday a teammate assumed I was Chinese anyway- I never said my race all I said was â€œthat is racist, Iâ€™m American FYIâ€ when the teammate called me Chinese. He got everyone else on his team to join in and harass me. I was born in Arizona. Like why??? And then I muted him and advised everyone else on the enemy team to report them for racism, which they did and we saw a penalty was issued for in-game chat, but it doesnâ€™t solve the overall issue. I feel ashamed almost to be Asian in America. It hurts. I was being called a â€œgookâ€, being told â€œChina has the highest suicide rates u should think about that :)â€ or calling me ling ling and saying I eat dogs and spread corona virus. I am KOREAN AMERICAN, born in the US, I have never ever been to Korea! I have family from there who have been in the USA since they were children as well. But all the racism Iâ€™ve encountered in just 2 games within the same week when itâ€™s never been that way before is a telling sign that hate racism is coming back strong. I thought there would be acceptance with diversity like how it was during Obamaâ€™s term, as a child during bushâ€™s term I was bullied as a kid for my race. As a teen I felt safe because racism was extremely minimized during Obamaâ€™s term. You would just see a few nasty racist commenters online. But itâ€™s far worse now. Itâ€™s back to the bush era of racism, but way worse. You hear caucasians joke about â€œdeporting Mexicansâ€ but itâ€™s not a joke at all. Iâ€™m sorry to say, but if caucasians want to joke and abuse Asians about how all Asians spread diseases, did they forget that Caucasian people contracted aids first??? Like I can be a bitch too, but I chose not to and to report them in game. Either way though, Iâ€™m not used to this bullying racism in the video games I play, but I guess I should expect it now after everything. Not sure why Iâ€™m even doing this. Just hurt I guess.",,

And I'm living with a Mexican American roommate. In the morning on March 27th, 2020, I was on my way back from the laundry room to my dorm room. And I saw that four of papers about coronavirus posted on my room door. That paper was posted by housing staff one paper per each room, which have content about coronavirus. When I saw that, I thought this is the racial discrimination clearly. Because the paper was posted a month ago, but it suddenly happened that day. Also my room was only one like that. 
  So I took a picture of my room door and trynna report this problem. First I showed my room door to RA in our dormitory, and she cognized this is the racial problem and said that she's gonna talk with supervisor about this situation. So I send her a picture of my door and said I'm gonna go to housing office too, she said okay. After that, I went to the housing office to figure it out. I went to one of the staff in the office and just showed picture to her. I immediately recognized this is a serious problem, and grabbed my phone and showed the supervisor in the other room. Then she let me in and said that this is a serious problem and gonna fix this situation as soon as possible. Supervisor said this is a serious problem on campus and will give a strong penalty to who did this. 
  After that, I went back to my room and saw my roommate coming in our room. I asked hime about this situation whether he saw or not. He said that he didn't see that so I show him a picture. Then he said his friend may did that. So I asked my roommate for the information of his friend to contact but he said no. So I asked him to call or contact his friend but he said no neither. I got his name at last, Shane. At that moment, one girl showed up and was waiting opposite room of our room. I asked her it it's Shane's room because I felt like that, she said yes. So we were waiting for him in the hallway. About 10 minutes later, one guy was coming to the room, that was Shane. I said hi and told him about this situation if we did that, he said he did. So I wanna talk about this problem deeply but it didn't wanna talk with me and just said sorry to me roughly. I felt disregarded but trynna talk to him. But he just walked into his room, and I came back to my room. 
  Then, I thought it should be said so I trynna talk to him one more time. I knocked his room and he opened the door so we could talk for a while. During the conversation we had the same attitude that he doesn't wanna talk bout it more, but we changed some world for a short minute. During the conversation, Shane suddenly punched my face and yelled me to get out. I was in panic but I punched back because I felt threat from him. That was obvious threat. During that fight, Michael, my roommate keep holding me and Shane kept hitting me, I tried to break it out. Even he threw everything on his sight to me and I got out of the room. 
  I thought that I should report this situation, so I went to the lobby, but there's nobody. So I came back to my dorm to wait somebody to help. On my way to my room, I felt victimized so much. So I kicked his room door twice, and the door got damaged little bit and opened. There were three people in that room, Shane, Michael, and one girl. I asked him why he hit me and he just told me to get out. And he suddenly pull out the shotgun from his room. I felt so scared and get out the room. And I sent a message to my dorm RA to help me, and was waiting for her in the lobby because I felt so unsafe in my room. And the RA came, during that time, the other sides called the police me as an attacker, then police came to me and I got investigated. During the investigation, I told the officer that this is clearly racial discrimination and hate crime, also fully wrote down the statement as it is. After that, I got detained for a while. 
  I felt so victimized because I didn't even mean to attack him and just wanna talked with him. But he suddenly attacked me. Everybody whom I showed the picture and explained my situation, they all recognized as a serious racial problem and also I behaved very rationally about this situation. This is the clear Racial Discrimination and I am physically and mentally distressed about this situation.",SNS Messages (Instagram),

I even called Safeway's Customer Service to report this, the rude unprofessional male agent was nasty and didn't care, and refused to help me, then he hung up the phone on me! At Starbucks I went to buy a drink. I asked the male employee where's the menu? He immediately told me if you want a drink you have to order on the APP. Yet the people who came after me and there were quite a few, he offered several people to take their order directly without using the APP. At Safeway I was yelled at and accused by a Black older Woman at the Customer Service desk. She kept insisting I was lying when the Safeway cashier rang up all my items except one at the incorrect price and she didn't have a clue how to correct her own mistake. After trying to correct her mistakes, now it is 20 minutes standing at the cash register and the line of customers is getting longer and longer. She then gave up and did not know how to correct the prices. She told me to go to the customer service desk. In addition to being yelled at, accused, and humiliated in front of all the customers by the Black Woman, I was at customer service desk for another 15-20 more minutes. At Smart & Final in Richmond CA they have red markers on the floor to stand 6 feet apart. The woman in front of me wasn't even standing on the red mark at all, and there was another guy in front of her. The employees completely ignored these people who were standing there a lot longer than me and never said anything to them and did not harass anyone else in the entire store. I was the last person who walked up to the line and was not even standing there very long and was immediately harassed and yelled at. They sure didn't waste their time with me. A White older female employee who walked by me and the older White female cashier named Jessica, both of them harassed me and both of them yelled at me saying Stand on the red mark! I was standing on the red mark and I didn't say anything back to either one of them and just kept silent. This is getting so out of control three different businesses all on the same day!

This was disgusting and disturbing to experience and to even witness. I immediately screenshotted the story and posted it to my Instagram stories, tagging the original poster as well, Zach Seiler. As soon as the offender saw what I had shared, he immediately threw even more racist and xenophobic remarks: â€œThatâ€™s right f*** you slat eye gooks,â€ Seiler wrote. â€œGet the f*** back to your poor ass country you dog eating bat munching no good freak-o-lops. God damn zipperheads are ruining my chance at the American Dream. You should be grateful I donâ€™t have a one way ticket to your worthless pathetic country yet.â€
This is completely unacceptable and it is behavior like this that leads to physical assaults! If people think they can get away with saying racist things online, what's to say they will be scared of getting repercussions for beating up an older Asian woman/man. Zach Seiler needs to be made an example for others with the same racist mentality.

However, I am still submitting this form to help capture the racial attacks that our community has been seeing as a result of Covid. 

The attack occurred when my mother was on her way to work. A tall African-American male was looking at my mother aggressively on the bus. When she got off her stop, the same man also got off and physically attacked my mother on her arm while muttering obscenities about asians and Covid-19. I don't have the details on how he attacked her (i.e. punch, kick, item, etc) as my mother did not see him as he was behind her. From what it sounds like, this man appeared to forcefully ""bump"" into my mother as he was getting off the bus. This attack left a bruise on my mother's arm for a week. A similar incident occurred on the transit a week after with a different male individual (repeatedly asked her if she was 'Chinese' on the bus), however fortunately, this did not result in a physical attack.",,

Any reasonable professional would respond - but apparently as a friend of mine put it you seem to lack any kind of professional behavior .    As I was told by Ms. Krause, another extremely unprofessional clerk in your organization you appear to be too busy to have the least respect of responding to my emails. While I would never say that my friend seems to have found the right words. What else did you expect ?    As I was born into a civilized culture (in which people  in professional settings respond) I have a lack of understanding for the fact that despite decades of warnings Chinese people eat bats and rats and continue to provide the perfect incubator for viruses. Even the regressive New York times has to admit that. Perhaps your research should focus on why in the 22nd century Chinese people are still eat bats and bring livestock on a market to slaughter it thereâ€¦   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html    https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/2/12/21133560/coronavirus-china-bats-pangolin-zoonotic-disease?__c=1   These practices have resulted in great cultural enrichments such as SARS or perhaps the next disease- the Hanta virus .   https://www.cnbctv18.com/healthcare/hantavirus-in-china-after-coronavirus-havoc-man-dies-of-rat-caused-disease-all-you-need-to-know-5548201.htm   I just hope that you never have to bury a loved one because of otherâ€™s people cultural eating habits. Just 800 to 900 every day in Italy.   Actually today it will be another 1200  here in our country ! They are all dying because of open borders and some folks eating bats and rats and bring it to the market !   And to top this our Chinese friends are still trying to sell us low quality stuff to make a buck on the back of the dead https://www.nationalreview.com/news/china-supplied-faulty-coronavirus-test-kits-to-spain-czech-republic/     In a few days we will more Americas dead then on 9/11 , the Gulf war and Pearl Harbor ! Perhaps we will even top Vietnam !   Taking above said  into perspective it is really unreasonable to expect that someone like you would even have the professional courtesy to reply.   I hope you find my research  useful .  In case you are wondering if the staggering 10 million who lost their jobs and economic lives due to the diverse eating habits of these wonderful friends of ours could have a case against the Chinese assets in this country I can assure that justice will not be served.  Even torturer get away due to the Sovereign State Immunity clause and the fact that China has a large history of torturing its own prisoners and profiting from prison labor (including the sale of organs). In addition thousands of our factories and millions of our jobs have gone there to China before without anyone willing to stop it.  The Chinese government has against all trade regulations practiced illegal  dumping and stolen billions in intellectual property.The times when we had great Presidents like FDR who knew what to do after Pearl Harbor are over. There is no Harry Truman on the horizon. Not even our great President Trump will retaliate as Truman would have doneâ€¦.  God Bless Mr. Truman - he was out of the right stuff. By the way, a woman should never ever be president . Thank God that Hillary lost.    I certainly hope you are not offended by this nor would this ever be my intent. Diversity makes us all strong and kills the rest.   Your failure to have even the most basic manners and to respond to my prior e-mail can therefore very easily be explained.

 This part is true. You morons are snowflakes who have been brainwashed by the universities communist professors who were indoctrinated by the USSR trained professors of the 1950-70's. It is so very sad to see the rebellious young people (students) to be taken advantage of when they show up with good values taught by GOD loving married couples with morals to be instructed by commies that parents are old fashion and dismisses everything they were instilled by them. Thinking that these commies are very smart and must be right eat up the swell and become like them. One day those lost to communism/socialism that do wake up to the truth that they were brainwashed will sue the crap out of these communist universities.    ",,

The point is, I prepared by bringing a mask to a place that traditionally would have crowds of people from different countries and who were traveling as tourists. As someone at higher risk for complications from the virus, I have asthma, I was trying to protect myself, and was also protecting others by practicing mask wearing.

After I ask for recording that she said I can how many courses in CSN just in case I would need it for further help in future, and she just change her mind again said she did not know since she did not has my file on her hand. I felt that was ridiculous. I made this appointment week ago she should have my file to help me to plan my course. Then, I said I was confused about internship program she said she will send me the details about the internship but she did not, not even the record about our conversation which should be sent every time after a advisor helped student for course planning at least. She did not even send my course planning to me which was my main purpose for this appointment. After a while I received a phone call that she said she was going to dropping my summer courses immediately. I am so confused how could she just cancel my permission and cancel my courses after I got the permission from advising center via online application. I have my proof of the course I am taking and everything was checked by the advisor. How could she just give me a phone call and said she gonna drop my courses??

First incident was when I was waiting to be helped at the meat counter at Whole Foods. I waited an abnormally long time to be helped -- there were many employees around, but no one seemed to want to help me. Then, one of the meat department employees went to help a white male, who had arrived after me. I then told them that I was here first; the white male customer was very nice about it, apologized, and stepped aside. The employee however then asks me rudely what my number is. He did not ask the white male customer what his number was before starting to help him. I tell him my ticket number. He then walks over to a non-Asian woman, asks her which number she has, and she then says a number higher than mine. He then proceeds to help her, leaving both the white male customer and I completely dumbfounded. The white male customer then says to me, ""Um what happened there? Why is he helping her; what was the point of him asking for your number?"" 

Second incident was when I was waiting to check out. A friendly customer asked me which checkout lane I was waiting for, and I pointed to the one on the right. He then said he'd wait for the line on the left then. When he saw that the lane he was in was moving faster than mine, he kindly told me to go ahead of him and he'd take my spot instead. I asked him if he was sure, and he said yes. The cashier then proceeds to yell at me and berate me repeatedly about how rude I was to cut in line, and how line cutters are horrible, and that I need to get back in line. The customer then tells her that he told me to go in front of him. The cashier continues to yell at me that I was so rude and a line cutter. She causes a scene while doing so. 

I've never been yelled at by any retail worker before; this was incredibly appalling. Both incidents left a horrible taste in my mouth and I no longer want to be a customer at Whole Foods when it treats its customers so poorly. I've shopped at this location for three years since moving to this city and no longer want to shop there anymore. 

While neither employee used a racial slur against me, after having mentioned these incidents to my family and friends, everyone has agreed that both were racist incidents because I'm Asian American.",,

The caucasian female customer, in her 40's, was chatting with her husband, when she suddenly saw my mom she immediately yelled ""Back up!!! Back up more!!! Back up!!! Do me you understand me?!!!"" in an aggressive, loud, condescending manner, multiple times until my mother was about 15 feet away. She complied and didn't say anything. When it was her turn to pay, my mother tried to be friendly with the cashier and said ""Some people just have a bad day, it's ok."" The young male cashier just stared at her blankly and then tossed the receipt with a backhand at her face. She left quietly.

I can provide you more detail  information about this case from last year.  It occurred at Krause Children's Center(Residential Treatment Center) in Katy Texas. I am working as a LPC student intern for my practicum class since 2019. During the group therapy session that I was conducting as a group therapist, the participants insulted me when I wearing a face mask by calling me ""Chinese"" and ""Asian is coronavirus"" and blaming me they could not hear me due to the mask but it was their racial insult as they did samely last February by complaining ""I cannot hear you"" and ""I cannot understand an single word"" and my supervisor already knew this issue of the participants. And, the participant came to me and coughed on my face deliberately then they made fun of me laughing at me together. I warned them it was rude and disrespectful behavior enough calling a police if it was done outside of the facility. And they threatened me I was discriminating them by their health condition: cough. After I conducted another group session, a participant coughed on my face two times on my way to office area. I reported this incident to my supervisor, Ms. Jamie Williams, to deal with this racial threat issue. However, she said I was fired immediately by Krause Children's Center since the participants complained about me and my session to their therapists. It was unfair and I lost my work even though I was the victim of racial discrimination. Wearing a face mask was to protect the participants and the staff and calling me ""Chinese, Asian"" is a serious expression of racism. It was not the first time. The same participant has done the same behavior last February and my supervisor, Ms, Jamie Williams, recognized the incident as well.",,

When we called her out for her racist banner, she said we have infringed her constitution right of free speech , slandered her as a racist since President Trump mentioned the same thing with no consequence and threatened a lawsuit against all that have voiced out.
She mentioned she worked in a law firm and know her legal right. It has been frustrating dealing with a racist without an avenue to ratify the situation.

The post was not approved. Instead, at 10PM, I got a visit from John at my door and started off by saying, ""I apologize if you felt that Fran was being racist, but the word Oriental is not racist. If it were racist, why is there a restaurant called Oriental Garden?"" and he continued to yell at my doorstep, waking up my children and scaring them. Eventually Fran came up and apologized and during the apology, John continued to yell and I asked Fran that he needs to stop talking then John left. There is also an email that was sent by John/Fran mistakenly that also said that Arnie (Board President) who is a Long Island Legislator, said the word is not racially motivated but politically incorrect. How is word that was banned federally and state few years ago, not considered racist? The following day, I waited for AKAM to contact me since they are the one who deleted my post. I requested a written and signed apology from John/Fran and AKAM (after few emails going back and forth) decided that enough apologies were made and this was a closed case. I contacted AKAM and someone from the marketing dept asked for my info to elevate this to another. I have yet to hear from anyone from AKAM.

I always get singled out for the rudest, crudest treatment. If it were a non-Asian who didn't know and wasn't wearing a mask on the sidewalk, she would've just ignored them, or politely and warmly told them that the rules changed, and it was ok if they didn't know.

She definitely wouldn't have shouted at me so curtly and cruelly if I were non-Asian. If you look at the way she acts to every person who comes in without putting on the hand sanitizer, she'll be much nicer to some people than others. 

There's also always the assumption that I don't belong in such a store or environment - a bookstore, hip, intellectual, trendy - when I've been a Green Apple customer since my teens, when they had their original location in a different part of the City.

As we got out, I said, ""have a nice evening,"" and he completely ignored me. During a phone interview for a job in March, the interviewer asked me if they could hire me after the pandemic was over, and also coughed throughout the phone conversation but claimed it was just a cold he had from a week ago. Sometime in mid June, my mother told me her friend/co-worker was shopping at a Kroger in Spring, Texas, a suburb in Houston and a lady asked her, ""when are you going back to China?"" My mom's friend, shocked and confused, followed her to the cashier the lady was at and told her, ""you don't do that! First of all, I'm not Chinese!"" They didn't argue after that and Kroger employees did not interview. When my friend's mother returned to work that week as an essential employee, she tried to seek cope through a co-worker and told her what happened at the Kroger in Spring, Texas, the co-worker reported what they talked about to the manager and HR. My mother's friend was shocked and very traumatized that nobody would help her. On July 5th, I decided to go to a Kroger somewhere in Houston, Texas, and as I was going to my car after buying groceries, a man in a big oversized blue Chevrolet Silverado Pickup with wheels protruding out so far that it could overtake another lane, stared at me as I walked to me car. After I got in my car, a few minutes later, the guy in the blue oversized Silverado pickup drove next to my car and glanced at me for a second before driving away to the front of the Kroger. His pickup was also raised and customized and I don't know how it could be street legal because if he was pulled over, police would not be able to see the driver through his tinted windows or how high he is that they wouldn't be able to tell if he has his hands on the wheel or somewhere else, and what he could be reaching for. How these pickups are legal in the south, I don't know. Even in New York, my brother was wearing a mask in Manhattan, and someone a bicycle riding past him said, ""Selfish!"" Although we know that most incidents occur in California or New York where Asians have been since the 1800s, southern states never report their cases because it's bad rap for their southern state and normally the generations of Asians in the south are usually first or people that have just migrated to the U.S. and are afraid to report or say something. I'm reporting them now because I am getting tired of people in the south bullying me. Just a months ago in March, a man tried to confront me for driving too slow that he followed me for more than seven miles. I called the police and the police came out. I did not provoke that person. These cases just never get reported because light is never placed on southern states.",,Yes

Our neighbor has been on the board of directors for the past year, and he has scrutinized alleged violations of the HOA bylaws to the point of making many of us miserable. In particular, this neighbor has repeatedly harassed my wife and I regarding my mother-in-law parking in the guest/occupant parking spot. He does not want anyone to park in the guest spots in front of his house, because it ""ruins his view."" We ultimately decided to ignore him, but did agree to move the car to the street so as not to incite further harassment. Recently, I overheard him making disparaging remarks about my wife to another neighbor. When I confronted him outside to ask why it was he was spreading malicious rumors about us, he became infuriated, and advanced towards me (breaking the 6ft barrier while not wearing a mask) while carrying a large shovel. He proceeded to ""chest-bump"" me and told me ""I will put you down, little Asian man."" Out of self-defense, I shoved him back, and he seemed surprised at the reaction. This incident was shortly reported to the police, who stated this was simply a civil matter. When I reported this to the HOA manager, she was less than helpful, and proceeded to take the side of the neighbor in claiming that this was a dispute between neighbors. Two days later, this neighbor called one of his family members to verbally accost my mother-in-law, who is elderly and barely speaks English. She felt that her life was being threatened at that time. I again reported this to the HOA manager and, once again, she refused to escalate the issue, and instead took the side of the neighbor while also blaming my mother-in-law. I find it incredibly disheartening that, while my wife and I are risking our lives to take care of others affected by this terrible disease, petty individuals like this neighbor are inciting racial hatred against us in our community, and we are unable to seek any form of remedy from the HOA management. We would like to request any possible assistance from Asian American support organizations in bringing into the limelight this and other cases of discrimination against Asian Americans. Thank you.",,Yes

I was worried that he would stock me, since I can't be anonymous (I'm one of a very few Asians there). (he said he sees that I always put away my equipment, keep things clean and wear a mask). He asked the man to stop following me. The White man continued to stare me down until I left the gym. I do not scare easily, but I was nervous that he was going to follow me out of the gym and shoot me. That was the vibe I was getting. I was and am one of the only Asians in the gym. It was clear what he was saying to me, while other White people had their little sacks with them--he didn't tell them that they were contaminating the entire gym.
