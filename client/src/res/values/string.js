	TEXT: "The Hate Crime Map offers an anonymous platform for victims of hate-based assault and \
            crime to record their experiences so that researchers and policy makers have accurate \
            information about the causes and locations of hate crimes. In addition to reporting crimes, \
            you can search the data by race, gender, religion and other factors. To see data, hover \
            over a state. To report harassment or assault, click on “Report Incident” on toolbar.” \

        PARAGRAPH1: "This project maps hate-based harassment and assaults across the United States. We seek to highlight the stories of those under attack. The stories are painful, yet we must confront the truth of life in America for marginalized peoples.",
        PARAGRAPH2: "Although hate-based attacks—based on race, religion, gender identity, and other factors—have terrorized people since the dawn of US settler history, there has been a significant uptick since 2015. White nationalist proponents have felt empowered to express their views defiantly and publicly, without consequence.",
        PARAGRAPH3: "This project pushes back against such bigotry and seeks to expose the vicious reality of those who hate. The FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” We agree with this definition, though we wish to include hate-based harassment and systemic domestic violence.",
        PARAGRAPH4: "The effect of such violence is immeasurable and vastly underreported. Join us in speaking out!",

        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS1: "This map was made possible with funding from the UCLA Institute of American Cultures, UCLA Division of Social Sciences, and the UCLA American Indian Studies Center. Data was graciously provided by ProPublica’s Documenting Hate project and the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center. Published incidents were culled from newspaper reports by UCLA American Indian Studies Center staff and from self-reporting. Special thanks go to Campus GIS Coordinator Albert Kochaphum, UCLA Institute of Digital Research & Education, and Christopher Lam, brilliant UCLA engineering student, for their extraordinary work in creating a functional and sophisticated, yet accessible, map.",
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS2: "The developers would also like to give great thanks to Tanner Velten who laid the essential programming foundation for the map in its current iteration. Thanks also go to the originators of the \"Harass Map,\" which formed the foundation of the current map: Patrick Meier, PhD, a consultant on humanitarian technology and innovation; Andrew Schroeder, a geographic information systems expert; and Vanessa Díaz, assistant professor of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies at Loyola Marymount University. Final thanks to August Bai at Quantitative Analyst, Fannie Mae, and Aaron Cheng, \"rising\" senior at Menlo School, for helping to provide the COVID-19 data from Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center."
