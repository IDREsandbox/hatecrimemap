# Hate Crime Map

A project maintained by UCLA AISC that aims to map self-reported hate crimes around the United States. View the site here: http://hatecrimemap.com/.

For any suggestions/issues, please click the "Issues" tab at the top of this page and provide as much details as possible, including but not limited to: how to reproduce a bug and what the intended behavior is, or why a suggestion is needed/useful.

## <a name="about"></a>About Hate Crimes
Hate crime is a global and national human rights problem of significant concern. According to the latest FBI statistics, hate crimes in the United States have risen almost 22% between 2015 and 2018, with the vast majority reported as motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry bias (59.6% in 2018). Incidents are on the rise, but hate crimes statistics are notoriously unreliable. The definition of hate crime varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, underreporting is widespread, and law enforcement is reluctant to designate crimes as hate crimes. The need for a publicly available resource documenting hate crimes has never been greater, yet accurate data on the type and frequency of crimes is not available.

The Hate Crime Map seeks to address this need by providing a crowd-sourced platform that enables victims to report hate-based incidents in detail, and researchers to study the data. In addition to self-reported incidents, reports are culled from newspapers, and ProPublica and the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center have shared their data. For the reasons listed above, the data included herein represents only a fraction of the true number. For an accessible data table, please click "Show Data" in the menu.

This map was made possible with funding from the UCLA Institute of American Cultures, UCLA Division of Social Sciences, and the UCLA American Indian Studies Center. Data was graciously provided by ProPublica’s Documenting Hate project and the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center. Published incidents were culled from newspaper reports by UCLA American Indian Studies Center staff and from self-reporting. Special thanks go to Campus GIS Coordinator Albert Kochaphum, UCLA Institute of Digital Research & Education, and Christopher Lam, brilliant UCLA engineering student, for their extraordinary work in creating a functional and sophisticated, yet accessible, map. The developers would also like to give great thanks to Tanner Velten who laid the essential programming foundation for the map in its current iteration. Thanks also go to the originators of the “Harass Map,” which formed the foundation of the current map: Patrick Meier, PhD, a consultant on humanitarian technology and innovation; Andrew Schroeder, a geographic information systems expert; and Vanessa Díaz, assistant professor of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies at Loyola Marymount University. Final thanks to August Bai at Quantitative Analyst, Fannie Mae, and Aaron Cheng, "rising" senior at Menlo School, for helping to provide the COVID-19 data from Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center.
